A **mod** (short for "modification") is a community-created add-on that changes or extends the gameplay of Minecraft. Mods can introduce new features, mechanics, items, blocks, or even overhaul entire systems. They are a core part of the Minecraft community, enabling endless creativity and customization.

## What Does a Mod Do?

Mods can:

- Add new items, blocks, and mobs
- Change game mechanics or rules
- Improve performance or visuals
- Add new user interfaces or quality-of-life features
- Integrate with other software or services

Mods can be **client-side** (affecting only your game), **server-side** (affecting multiplayer servers), or both. Always check a mod's documentation to see where it can be used.

## Mod Loaders

To use mods in Minecraft, you need a special tool called a **mod loader**. A mod loader is a program that helps Minecraft recognize and run mods, and it also provides a set of tools and APIs that mod developers use to create their mods. The three main mod loaders used today are Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.

| Mod Loader | Description                                                                                 | Notable Features                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forge**  | The oldest and most widely supported mod loader, known for its stability and compatibility. | Large mod library, especially for older versions; supports complex mods.                   |
| **Fabric** | A lightweight, modern mod loader designed for speed and quick updates.                      | Fast updates for new Minecraft versions; popular for performance and quality-of-life mods. |
| **Quilt**  | A recent fork of Fabric focused on modularity and community-driven development.             | Builds on Fabric’s foundation; offers greater flexibility and new features.                |

> **Note:** Mods are usually made for a specific mod loader and a specific version of Minecraft. Mods designed for one loader will not work with another, and using the wrong version can cause issues or crashes.

## Modding Communities

The Minecraft modding community is large and active, with several major platforms where you can find, download, and discuss mods.

- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods){rel="nofollow"} is the largest and most established mod hosting site, offering thousands of mods for all major loaders and Minecraft versions.
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods){rel="nofollow"} is a modern, open-source alternative that focuses on transparency and ease of use, quickly gaining popularity among both modders and players.
- For discussions, announcements, and support, the [Minecraft Forums](https://www.minecraftforum.net/){rel="nofollow"} remain a central hub for the community.

## Legal and Safety Notes

When downloading mods, it is important to use only trusted sources such as CurseForge or Modrinth. Downloading mods from unknown websites can put your computer at risk of malware or viruses.

::caution
Always respect the licenses and terms of use set by mod authors, and never redistribute mods without permission. Being cautious and following these guidelines helps keep the community safe and respectful.

## Version Compatibility

Mods are always made for a specific version of Minecraft and a specific mod loader. Before installing a mod, double-check that it matches both your Minecraft version and the mod loader you are using.

Attempting to use a mod with the wrong version or loader can lead to crashes, bugs, or other unexpected problems. Always read the mod’s documentation for compatibility information.

## FAQ

::accordion
  :::accordion-item{label="What is the difference between Forge and Fabric?"}
  Forge is older and has a larger library of mods, but Fabric is lighter and updates faster for new Minecraft versions. Mods are not compatible between loaders.
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Can I use multiple mod loaders at once?"}
  No, you must choose one mod loader per Minecraft installation. Some loaders (like Quilt) can run mods made for others (like Fabric), but not always perfectly.
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Are mods safe to use?"}
  Mods from trusted sources are generally safe. Always scan files for viruses and avoid downloading from unknown sites.
