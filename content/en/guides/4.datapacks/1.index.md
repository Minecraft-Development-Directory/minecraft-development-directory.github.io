A **datapack** is a collection of files that can change or extend Minecraft’s gameplay using only built-in game features—no external mods or plugins required. Datapacks are written in JSON and function files, and can add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, recipes, and more. They are supported natively by Minecraft Java Edition.

## What Does a Datapack Do?

Datapacks can:

- Add or modify crafting recipes
- Create custom advancements and achievements
- Change loot tables for mobs and chests
- Add new structures or world generation features
- Automate tasks with custom functions

Datapacks are easy to install and use, making them a popular choice for both players and server owners who want to customize their experience without requiring any software beyond Minecraft itself.
