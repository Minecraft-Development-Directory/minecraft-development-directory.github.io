A **Minecraft launcher** is a program that allows players to start and manage different versions of Minecraft, handle user authentication, install mods or resource packs, and customize the game experience. Custom launchers are often used by modded servers, communities, or projects that want to provide a tailored experience or automate setup for their players.

## What Does a Launcher Do?

Launchers can:

- Download and manage multiple Minecraft versions
- Handle user authentication (Mojang, Microsoft, or custom accounts)
- Install mods, modpacks, or resource packs automatically
- Provide custom news, branding, or server lists
- Offer update and repair features for game files

Custom launchers are especially useful for modded servers or large communities, as they simplify the installation process and ensure all players have the correct setup.

## Launcher Communities

The Minecraft launcher development community is active and supportive. Helpful resources include:

## Legal and Safety Notes

When developing or using a custom launcher, always respect Minecraft’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and Microsoft’s terms of service. Do not distribute pirated copies of the game or bypass authentication. Only download launchers from trusted sources, and be cautious of malware or scams.

## Version Compatibility

Launchers must be updated to support new Minecraft versions and authentication changes. Always check that your launcher and its dependencies are compatible with the Minecraft version you want to support.
