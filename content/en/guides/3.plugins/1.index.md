A **plugin** is a server-side extension that adds new features or changes the behavior of a Minecraft server, without requiring players to install anything on their own game. Plugins are most commonly used to manage multiplayer servers, add commands, protect worlds, create minigames, and customize gameplay for communities.

## What Does a Plugin Do?

Plugins can:

- Add new commands and permissions
- Manage worlds, regions, and player protections
- Create custom minigames and events
- Integrate with databases or external services
- Moderate chat and player actions

Unlike mods, plugins only affect the server and do not require any changes to the client. This makes them ideal for public or community servers where you want all players to have the same experience without extra setup.

## Plugin Platforms

To use plugins, a Minecraft server must run a special server platform that supports them. The main plugin platforms are listed below:

| Platform          | Description                                                                                       | Notable Features                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bukkit/Spigot** | The original and most widely used plugin platform, known for stability and a huge plugin library. | Large ecosystem, good documentation, supports most classic plugins.             |
| **Paper**         | A high-performance fork of Spigot with additional features and optimizations.                     | Better performance, more configuration options, supports Spigot plugins.        |
| **Purpur**        | A fork of Paper with even more customization and experimental features.                           | Advanced settings, experimental gameplay tweaks, supports Paper/Spigot plugins. |
| **Sponge**        | A modern platform with a different API, designed for flexibility and mod/plugin compatibility.    | Supports both plugins and some mods, used for custom server setups.             |

> **Note:** Plugins are made for specific platforms and Minecraft versions. Always check compatibility before installing.

## Plugin Communities

The plugin community is active and well-organized, with several major sites for finding and sharing plugins.

- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/){rel="nofollow"} is the largest plugin repository, offering thousands of plugins for Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper servers.
- [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/){rel="nofollow"} is a modern platform for Paper plugins, focusing on ease of use and transparency.
- The [Sponge](https://ore.spongepowered.org/){rel="nofollow"} project hosts its own plugin repository for Sponge servers.

## Legal and Safety Notes

Always download plugins from trusted sources like SpigotMC, Hangar, or the official Sponge site. Avoid unknown websites to reduce the risk of malware. Respect plugin licenses and do not redistribute plugins without permission. Following these guidelines helps keep servers safe and supports plugin developers.

## Version Compatibility

Plugins are version-specific and platform-specific. Make sure the plugin matches your server’s Minecraft version and platform (e.g., Paper, Spigot, or Sponge). Using the wrong version can cause errors or crashes. Always read the plugin’s documentation for compatibility details.

## FAQ

::accordion
  :::accordion-item{label="What is the difference between plugins and mods?"}
  Plugins only affect the server and do not require players to install anything, while mods can change both the client and server and usually require all players to have them installed.
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Can I use plugins and mods together?"}
  Some server platforms like Sponge or hybrid servers allow both, but most plugin platforms (like Spigot or Paper) do not support mods. Always check your server’s capabilities.
  
    ::::warning
    We strongly advise **against** attempting to run mods on standard plugin platforms like Spigot or Paper, as this can lead to severe server instability, crashes and incompatibilities.

  :::accordion-item{label="Are plugins safe to use?"}
  Plugins from trusted sources are generally safe. Always scan files for viruses and avoid downloading from unknown sites.
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="How do I install a plugin?"}
  Download the plugin’s `.jar` file and place it in your server’s `plugins` folder, then restart the server. Check the plugin’s documentation for setup instructions.

  :::accordion-item{label="Will plugins work on Minecraft Bedrock Edition?"}
  No, plugins described here are for Minecraft Java Edition servers only. Bedrock Edition uses a different system (add-ons/behavior packs).
